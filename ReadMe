Task: Write a program to design Vending Machine using your 'favourite language' with all possible tests.
1.  Accepts coins of 1,5,10,25 Cents, i.e. penny, nickel, dime, and a quarter.
2.  Allow user to select products Coke(25), Pepsi(35), Soda(45)
3.  Allow user to take refund by cancelling the request.
4. Return the selected product and remaining change if any.
5. Allow reset operation for vending machine supplier.


In this task, I used OOP part of the Java, for loops, if and switch statements.

If my implementation of Java Vending Machine has the following classes ;

Product Class:
There is a constructor method in this class with three parameters(String name, int count, int price).
Additionally, I used encapsulation in this class.

ProductUnitTest Class:
In this class, I created a product object and made a confirmation.

Vending Machine Class:
I created the methods that I used for accepts coins, select products, take refund etc.
In this class, I  initialized the amount of the total product, and I calculated the price.

VendingMAchineTest Class:
In this class, I use the scanner class for taking input from the user.
Unless the user wants to pass the next step, the machine accepts money from the user.
If the user still has enough balance may buy the product.
In this class, I also gave the list of the product and their prices.
